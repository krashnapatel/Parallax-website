        <p class="text">
            Paragliding is the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying paragliders: lightweight, free-flying, foot-launched glider aircraft with no rigid primary structure.[1] The pilot sits in a harness or in a cocoon-like 'pod' suspended below a fabric wing. Wing shape is maintained by the suspension lines, the pressure of air entering vents in the front of the wing, and the aerodynamic forces of the air flowing over the outside.

            1. Impaired Muscle Power
            Surfers with impaired muscle power have an underlying health condition that either eliminates or reduces their ability to voluntarily contract muscles to move or to generate force.
            
            Examples include spinal cord injury - complete or incomplete, tetra-or paraplegia - muscular dystrophy, post-polio syndrome, and spina bifida.

            <br>
            2. Impaired Passive Range of Movement
            Surfers with impaired range of movement have a lack or a restriction of passive motion in one or more joints.
            
            Examples include arthrogryposis and contracture resulting from chronic joint immobilization or trauma affecting a joint.
